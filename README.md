FileSearch
    A rather simple search program that looks for and returns the path of any file on your PC(provided you input the filename and format
    correctly). The program depends on some local hard disk folders still having default names(i.e if you change Users in C:\Users the algorithm will break.
    Search is optimized for speed by checking certain file folders first depending on the file format of your input. Implemented with the C++ <filesystem> header.
